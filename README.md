# FsGrpc
Idiomatic F# code generation for Protocol Buffers and gRPC

This is currently a work in progress.  Code generation for protocol buffers (but not gRPC) is currently working but considered an alpha version.

The major features intended are:
1. Protobuf Messages as immutable F# record types
2. Oneofs as Discriminated Unions
3. proto3 optional keyword support
